# **Personal Learnings:**
Even though I worked with PHP 4 and PHP 5 so many years ago for a small project with MySQL, introducing me into a CMS as WordPress was new for me.

This project helped me a lot to improve my PHP 7, WordPress and SASS skill.

This course from Yoney Gallardo YouTube channel was very useful for my me. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFJdmHzNwfQ&t=58s) to access to the course.
Another course that I recommend is this that could be found on Linda.com: [WordPress 5 Essential Training by Morten-Rand-Hendriksen](https://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/WordPress-5-Essential-Training/651229-2.html). Thank Patricia Moura for the advice for this course.
